# Comparison-of-Face-Detection-Systems-for-Oblique-Profile-View
This is a project about performance analysis of face detection tool (CMU Deva Face Detector, OpenFace, Face++) working in the wild and under different imaging conditions (Face rotation, Black and White Image, etc), exploring the causes of performance differences.

Their performances are compared on finding faces and landmark locations in the 300w dataset (Sagonas et al, 2016) and AFLW,dataset (Koestinger et al, 2011), and their predictions are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively through manual and automated processes. The analysis involves visualizing landmarks on top of images, computing the confusion matrix of face detection decisions, and computing the face-sizenormalized point-to-point error between a set of predicted and annotated landmark locations.

It is a good and friendly report for the beginner for computer vision, reader can easily to understand fundamental theory   computer vision, design their owen some automitc scripts and tools to handle their images.
