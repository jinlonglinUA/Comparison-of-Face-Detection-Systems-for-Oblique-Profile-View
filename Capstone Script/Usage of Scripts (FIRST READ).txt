The following are main script:

(1)confusionmatrix.py is to generate the confusionmatrix table about TP,FP,FN.
(2)FaceAccurateCalculator.py is to compute Mean Error of Euclidean Distance.
How to run it ? see README.md

The second part of scripts (the usage is showed in the code):

(1)invalid_statistics.py:count the number of undetected faces which are rotated by mathmatical z axis based on confusionmatrix table, and its distribution.
(2)slope.py: count the number of undetected faces which are rotated by mathmatical x axis based on confusionmatrix table, the distribution of undetected images in specifc angle.
(3)isGreyScale.py: using RGB feature to determine the image is Monochromatic image or not. This script is used to count the number of Monochromatic images and extract them.

The third part of scripts (tools):
(1)convexHull_Visulization.py to draw the convexHull after given annotation points and detection points.
(2)ImageVisialization.py to visual the point on the images.


The fourth part of scripts (data get);
(1)extract_from_AFLW.py: extract the data from AFLW database about the AFLW annotation information.
(2)RunFace++.py: how ot use the Face++ API
(3)RunOpenFace.sh: how ot run OpenFace after you have install this system.

The following excel table record the conversion inforamtion between Openface, Face++ and Deva in 300w and AFLW dataset
